Overview of the Project
The Student Grade Manager is a GUI-based Java application designed to calculate a student's average grade, determine their letter grade, and compute their GPA. The program provides an intuitive interface where users can input grades for up to four subjects, calculate results, and reset the fields as needed.

This application demonstrates the use of Java Swing for creating graphical user interfaces, event-driven programming, and basic mathematical operations.

Project Objectives
Simplify grade calculation and GPA determination for students and educators.
Provide a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface.
Implement robust input validation and error handling.
Demonstrate Java programming skills with a focus on GUI design using Swing.
Key Activities
Design and Layout:

Created a responsive and user-friendly interface using Java Swing.
Divided the interface into input fields, action buttons, and result displays.
Functionality Implementation:

Implemented logic to calculate the average grade, determine the letter grade, and compute the GPA based on input.
Added features to clear input and output fields.
Input Validation:

Validated user input to ensure only valid numerical grades are accepted.
Displayed error messages for invalid input using JOptionPane.
Testing and Debugging:

Tested for edge cases, such as missing or invalid input, and ensured accurate calculations.
Technology Used
Programming Language: Java

For core logic, input validation, and event handling.
Swing Library:

Used for GUI components like JFrame, JLabel, JTextField, and JButton.
AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):

Utilized for layout management and handling user interactions.
JOptionPane:

Used for displaying error messages to the user.
